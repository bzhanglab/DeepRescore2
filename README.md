# DeepRescore2: deep learning prediction boosts phosphoproteomics-based discoveries through improved phosphopeptide identification

<img src="Image/Pipeline2.png" alt="Logo" width="390" align = "right">

**Shotgun phosphoproteomics** enables high-throughput analysis of phosphopeptides in biological samples. One of the primary challenges associated with this technology is the relatively low rate of phosphopeptide identification during data analysis. This limitation hampers the full realization of the potential offered by shotgun phosphoproteomics. Here we present **DeepRescore2**, a computational workflow that leverages **deep learning-based retention time and fragment ion intensity predictions** to improve **phosphopeptide identification** and **phosphosite localization**. Using a state-of-art computational workflow as a benchmark, DeepRescore2 increases the number of correctly identified peptide-spectrum matches by 17% in a synthetic dataset and identifies 19%-46% more phosphopeptides in biological datasets. In a liver cancer dataset, 30% of the significantly altered phosphosites between tumor and normal tissues and 60% of the prognosis-associated phosphosites identified from DeepRescore2-processed data could not be identified based on the state-of-the-art workflow. Notably, DeepRescore2-processed data uniquely identifies EGFR hyperactivation as a new target in poor-prognosis liver cancer, which is validated experimentally. Integration of deep learning prediction in DeepRescore2 improves phosphopeptide identification and facilitates biological discoveries.

- **Script** implements DeepRescore2 to improve phosphopeptide identification and phosphosite localization.
- **Parameters** include 9 parameter files for the three test datasets of four search engines used in our manuscript, including label free dataset (PRIDE ID: PXD000138 and PXD023665) and UCEC TMT dataset, respectively.
- **Install** includes scripts for installing DeepRescore2, e.g., configuring the deep learning conda environment, and installing R packages.

## Customize environment for DeepRescore2
### Our DeepRescore2 environment
- Windows 10 64bit. To meet the Docker Desktop requirements, the Windows system needs to be running Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, or Home (18363+) as the operating system version.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). To provide command-line interface (CLI) for users to execute the workflow, the Git on Windows system needs to be installed.
- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/install/). Both [PGA](https://github.com/wenbostar/PGA) and [Percolator](https://github.com/percolator/percolator) were installed using Docker.
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download). We built three conda environments for [AutoRT](https://github.com/bzhanglab/AutoRT), [pDeep3](https://github.com/pFindStudio/pDeep3) and R, respectively, to meet the requirements of different environment verisons, e.g. tensorflow.

### Computational Time
- The computational time required by DeepRescore2 is dependent on various factors, such as the size of the dataset and the specific hardware configuration.
- Due to the involvement of deep learning models, DeepRescore2 may require more computational time than traditional search engine + localization steps.
- For the synthetic dataset, it took approximately 2 hours to complete the analysis using a Windows machine.
- For the UCEC TMT dataset, the analysis required approximately 9 hours to complete using a Windows machine.

### Installation
- Download Git on the windows systemï¼š https://git-scm.com/downloads Right-click the mouse to open the Git Bash. **Please install and run DeepRescore2 under Git Bash as an administrator.**
- Install [Docker Desktop for Windows system](https://docs.docker.com/install/) (>=19.03).
- Install [Anaconda for Windows system](https://www.anaconda.com/download) and get the Conda path (default is in /C/ProgramData/anaconda3).
- Download and install DeepRescore2 in your folder.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/bzhanglab/DeepRescore2.git
$ cd DeepRescore2
$ ./Install/InstallDependency.sh . $AnacondaPath
```
**After installation, please verify whether the AutoRT, pDeep3, and R_env conda environments exist in the Anaconda environment folder (typically located at C:\ProgramData\anaconda3\envs) or not.**

### Data type
- Instrument Type: The proposed approach, DeepRescore2, is designed to be applicable to mass spectrometry-based proteomics data obtained from various types of instruments, including but not limited to Orbitrap, Q-TOF, and ion trap instruments.
- Peptide Type: DeepRescore2 is applicable to different types of peptides, including both labeled (e.g., TMT-labeled) and unlabeled peptides. However, it is important to note that DeepRescore2 is specifically designed to handle peptides with phosphorylation modification.
- The current version supports four search engines, [MS-GF+ (v2019.02.28)](https://github.com/MSGFPlus/msgfplus), [Comet (2018.01 rev.4)](http://comet-ms.sourceforge.net/), [X!Tandem (v2017.2.1.2)](https://www.thegpm.org/TANDEM/), and [MaxQuant (v1.6.5.0)](https://maxquant.org/).
- Computational Requirements: Currently, DeepRescore2 only supports running on Windows systems. The computational requirements for running DeepRescore2 depend on the size of the dataset and the specific hardware configuration. DeepRescore2 utilizes deep learning models, and the computational demands may increase with larger datasets. We recommend running DeepRescore2 on a machine with sufficient computational resources, such as a multi-core CPU and a GPU, to ensure efficient processing.

## Other functions

### Quantification for TMT dataset

In our manuscript, we used [MASCI](https://github.com/PNNL-Comp-Mass-Spec/MASIC) to perform the TMT quantification for both TMT10 (UCEC) and TMT11 (HCC) datasets. We prepared the original scripts we used for the quantification under the 'Script/TMTQuantification' folder. You can change the input data path and parameters used for MASCI following our scripts to do the TMT quantification.

### Kinase activity score inference
In our manuscript, we performed kinase activity score inference for the HCC datasets. We prepared the original scripts we used under the 'Script/KinaseActivityScoreInference' folder. The excel file ('mmc4.xlsx') contains the list of known targets that we used for the inference. You can change the input data path and parameters to do the kinase activity score inference.
